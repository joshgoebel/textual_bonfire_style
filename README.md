# Bonfire

Bonfire is a nice and light theme for Textual originally based on the asthetics of 37signals' popular [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com) chat web service. Since then it's taken design inspriation from a variety of sources ([HipChat](http://hipchat.com), [Slack](http://slack.com), etc). 

The dark sides can be turned on and off with *Darken main window colors* preference found under *Appearance/User Interface*. I happen to like them dark, so that's what I used for the sample snap.

## Older Versions

### Textual 3.x and 4.x

Use the [textual4](https://github.com/yyyc514/textual_bonfire_style/tree/textual4) branch.

Pretty sure they will both work with the `textual4` branch.  If not you can try to keep going backwards in the commit history until you find something that works.

### Textual 2.1.1+ and 2.1.x

Try commit `a8c48d88a90c011c808332020cd33e1e419b876d` and if you have no idea what that means, please use a newer version of Textual.

### Texual 2.1.0

Use the [textual_21](https://github.com/yyyc514/textual_bonfire_style/tree/textual_21) branch.
